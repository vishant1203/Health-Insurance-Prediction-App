## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was developed for **Shield Insurance** by **AtliQ AI** with the objective of building a predictive model that can accurately estimate health insurance premiums.  

The solution has two phases:  
- **Phase 1 (MVP)** – Build and deploy a predictive model with a Streamlit application.  
- **Phase 2 (Future Scope)** – Develop infrastructure for straight-through processing (STP) of insurance quotes.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Achieve **>97% accuracy** in premium prediction.  
- Ensure **95% of predictions** are within **±10% error** of the actual value.  
- Provide an **interactive Streamlit app** for real-time predictions.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features  
- Data preprocessing and EDA for insurance datasets.  
- Trained and optimized machine learning models.  
- Interactive **Streamlit web app** for premium calculation.  
- Cloud deployment – accessible from anywhere.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn / XGBoost / RandomForest**  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- **Streamlit** (deployment & UI)
